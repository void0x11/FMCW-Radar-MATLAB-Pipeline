# FMCW-Radar-MATLAB-Pipeline

End-to-end FMCW radar signal processing pipeline in MATLAB, written to demonstrate practical DSP and radar-processing skills.  
The pipeline goes from waveform generation to target range/velocity estimation and visualization.

This repository focuses on clarity and repeatability. It is structured as a standalone learning / experimentation environment, not tied to proprietary hardware or unpublished datasets.

## Core Capabilities

1. FMCW waveform generation  
   - Defines chirp parameters (bandwidth, slope, PRI, sampling rate).
   - Simulates transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) signals for one or more point targets.

2. Beat signal extraction  
   - Mixes Tx and Rx to generate the IF beat signal.
   - Applies windowing (e.g. Hanning) to control spectral leakage before the FFT.

3. Range FFT  
   - Computes the 1D FFT of the beat signal.
   - Finds peak frequency and maps it to physical range using radar equations.

4. Doppler / velocity estimation  
   - Models multiple chirps over time.
   - Uses 2D FFT (range–Doppler map) to separate targets by radial velocity.

5. Visualization  
   - Plots:
     - Time-domain Tx / Rx / beat signals.
     - Range spectrum (magnitude vs range).
     - Range–Doppler map (magnitude vs range vs velocity).
   - Includes annotations showing the estimated range and velocity of the strongest target.

## Repository Layout

`scripts/`
- `FMCW_Params.m`  
  Defines all radar parameters (carrier freq, bandwidth, chirp time, Fs, max range, max velocity, etc.) in one place.

- `Sim_TargetScene.m`  
  Creates one or more simulated targets with specified range and radial velocity, and returns the received signal.

- `Generate_Chirp.m`  
  Generates the FMCW transmit signal (linear up-chirp).

- `Mixer_IFBeat.m`  
  Mixes Tx and Rx to produce the beat signal (intermediate frequency).

- `RangeFFT.m`  
  Applies windowing and computes FFT to estimate range.

- `RangeDopplerFFT.m`  
  Builds slow-time snapshots and performs 2D FFT to estimate both range and velocity.

- `Run_Demo.m`  
  High-level script that ties everything together:
  1. Load parameters
  2. Simulate target(s)
  3. Generate Tx/Rx
  4. Form beat signal
  5. Compute range / Doppler
  6. Plot results

`figures/`
- Example output plots generated by `Run_Demo.m` (PNG).  
  These make the repo readable without running code.

`docs/`
- `signal_chain_explained.md`  
  Friendly explanation of the math behind FMCW range and Doppler extraction.
