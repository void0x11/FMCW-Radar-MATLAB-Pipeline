# FMCW-Radar-MATLAB-Pipeline

Complete FMCW radar signal-processing chain implemented in MATLAB.

This project walks through the practical DSP steps behind an FMCW (Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave) radar: from chirp generation, to dechirping and FFT-based range estimation, to basic range–Doppler analysis. The code is organized as a reproducible pipeline rather than a single monolithic script.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate:
- Working understanding of radar DSP (not just plotting signals).
- Clean, modular MATLAB implementation.
- Physically consistent parameter selection (chirp slope, sweep time, sampling rate, etc.).
- Transparent, inspectable processing steps that mirror real radar post-processing.

This repository is self-contained and simulation-driven. It does **not** include proprietary hardware data, unpublished fusion logic, or any system-specific calibration.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. FMCW waveform generation
- Defines all chirp parameters (carrier frequency, bandwidth, sweep time, chirp slope, PRI, sampling rate).
- Generates a train of up-chirps using `phased.FMCWWaveform`.

### 2. Scene / target simulation
- Models a moving point target with a given range and radial velocity.
- Propagates the transmitted signal through free space, applies target radar cross section (RCS), and collects the return.
- Adds receive-chain gain and controlled AWGN to approximate realistic SNR.

### 3. Beat signal formation
- Mixes the received and transmitted signals to generate the dechirped IF beat signal.
- Splits the long capture into individual sweeps (fast-time vs slow-time).
- Optionally identifies valid up-chirps using instantaneous phase slope.

### 4. Range estimation (1D FFT)
- Applies windowing (Hann window) to control spectral leakage.
- Computes the FFT of a single chirp’s beat signal.
- Locates the dominant beat frequency and converts it to physical range using:
  
  \[
  R \approx \frac{c \cdot f_b}{2 \cdot \mu}
  \]
  
  where \( c \) is the speed of light, \( f_b \) is the beat frequency, and \( \mu \) is the chirp slope.

### 5. Range–Doppler / velocity insight (2D FFT)
- Uses multiple chirps over slow time.
- Performs a 2D FFT (fast-time → range, slow-time → Doppler) to visualize how targets separate in both range and radial velocity.
- Produces a standard range–Doppler magnitude map.

### 6. Visualization
- Time-domain view of Rx.
- Range spectrum (magnitude vs estimated range).
- Range–Doppler heatmap.
- Printed console output summarizing the estimated target range vs the true simulated range.

All plots in `figures/` are generated directly by the code in `Run_Demo.m`.

## Repository Layout

`scripts/`

- `FMCW_Params.m`  
  Centralizes all radar parameters in one struct (carrier frequency, bandwidth, chirp time, sampling rate, number of sweeps, etc.).  
  Also calculates derived quantities like chirp slope and expected beat frequency.

- `Generate_Chirp.m`  
  Builds the FMCW transmit waveform (a train of linear up-chirps) using the parameters in `FMCW_Params.m`.

- `Sim_TargetScene.m`  
  Simulates a single moving point target in free space:
  applies two-way propagation, simple RCS, receiver gain, and AWGN.
  Returns Tx and Rx as complex baseband signals.

- `Mixer_IFBeat.m`  
  Dechirps the received signal by mixing Rx with the conjugate of Tx to produce the IF beat signal.
  Reshapes the data into [fast-time x slow-time] form (sweeps vs chirps).
  Also tags up-chirps so slow-time processing stays consistent.

- `RangeFFT.m`  
  Estimates range from one sweep:
  1) Window the beat signal  
  2) FFT and peak-pick the beat frequency  
  3) Convert that frequency to meters using the FMCW range equation.

- `RangeDopplerFFT.m`  
  Builds a basic range–Doppler map using a 2D FFT across fast time (range bins) and slow time (Doppler bins).  
  Returns magnitude in dB along with physical axes for plotting.

- `Run_Demo.m`  
  High-level script that ties everything together:
  1. Load parameters  
  2. Generate waveform  
  3. Simulate target return  
  4. Form beat signal per chirp  
  5. Estimate range from a single sweep  
  6. Build a range–Doppler map and plot it

`figures/`  
Example output plots generated by `Run_Demo.m` (PNG).  
These snapshots make the repository readable even without running MATLAB.

`docs/`  
Additional notes and derivations.  
- `signal_chain_explained.md` gives an accessible walkthrough of the signal chain and math (why we mix, why we FFT, how slope and sweep time set resolution and unambiguous range).
